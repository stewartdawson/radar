By using the server header, you inform browsers that they should only use HTTPS to access your website, and should ignore downgrade attempts to contact the site via HTTP. Browser support is now widespread enough that this easy-to-implement feature should be considered for any site using HTTPS.'},

Most teams we work with favor bundling an embedded http server within your web application.'},

ES6 (aka ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015), the new version of JavaScript, addresses many of the concerns of the older versions currently in use.'},

Daggers strictly generated implementation and nonreliance on reflection-based solutions addresses many of the performance and development issues, thereby making it suitable for Android development. With Dagger, there is full traceability with easy debugging because the entire call stack for provision and creation is made available.'},
      {name: 'SignalR', description: 'We have a number of reservations about the use of HTML5 WebSockets. By allowing the server to initiate actions on the browser, WebSockets departs from the connectionless, request/response model that underpins the World Wide Web today. Security is another big risk with WebSockets. For example, the standard does not impose any cross-origin request policy. However, we do recognize that in certain monitoring or alerting applications, WebSockets can be very useful. If you need to build a .NET WebSockets server, SignalR conveniently implements much of the additional code you need for a robust production application. This includes some recommended security practices such as validating connection tokens and activating SSL when encryption is needed. Although ThoughtWorks teams have been very happy with SignalR, there are still fundamental issues with WebSockets that you should consider before diving in.'}],

Facebooks GraphQL is an interesting alternative to REST that might be a better approach for this very common use case.'}],

When a JSPatch-enabled app runs, it loads a chunk of JavaScript (potentially via an insecure HTTP connection) and then bridges to the main Objective-C application code to change behavior, fix bugs, and so on. While convenient, we think monkey-patching live apps is a bad idea and should be avoided.'}]}
